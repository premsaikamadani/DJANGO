“Can you explain Django folder structure?”

✅ Best Interview Answer (Simple + Professional)

Answer:

Django project is divided into project-level files and app-level files.
The project handles configuration, and apps handle business logic.



After running:

django-admin startproject myproject


You’ll see something like this 👇

myproject/
│
├── manage.py
│
├── myproject/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   ├── asgi.py
│   └── wsgi.py

1️⃣ manage.py (IMPORTANT ⭐)

👉 Command center of Django project

What it does:

Starts server

Runs migrations

Creates apps

Creates admin user

Real-time use:

python manage.py runserver
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser


🧠 Interview line

manage.py is used to interact with Django project through command-line.



2️⃣ Project Folder (myproject/)

This folder contains project-level configuration.

🔹 __init__.py

Makes this folder a Python package

Usually empty

Rarely touched



🔹 settings.py ⭐⭐⭐

👉 Heart of Django project

Contains:

Installed apps

Database config

Middleware

Templates

Static files

Security settings

Example:

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'users',
]


🧠 Real-time

Change database (SQLite → PostgreSQL)

Add apps

Configure AWS / email / security



settings.py

Central configuration file.

Contains database, installed apps, middleware, static files, security settings.

🗣 This file controls how the entire Django project behaves.





🔹 urls.py ⭐⭐

👉 URL routing file

Maps URL → View

Example:

from django.urls import path
from users.views import login

urlpatterns = [
    path('login/', login),
]


🧠 Real-time

Controls what happens when user hits a URL


urls.py

Handles URL routing

Maps URL → View function

🗣 When a request comes, Django first checks urls.py.




wsgi.py

👉 Used for deployment

Works with servers like Gunicorn

Used in AWS / production

🧠 You don’t touch this as fresher usually.


wsgi.py

Used for production deployment

Works with web servers like Gunicorn or Apache

🗣 Used when deploying Django application to production.


🔹 asgi.py

👉 Used for async features

WebSockets

Chat apps

Real-time notifications

🧠 Mostly for advanced apps.


asgi.py
